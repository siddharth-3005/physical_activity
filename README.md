Physical Activity Prediction:
   Dataset involves predicting the type of activity the user has engaged in based on several measurements taken from different sensors in a smartwatch.
   Build Decision Tree models after balancing the target variable, transforming, and performing feature engineering. physical_activity_before_pruning notebook contains a model built using max depth 10
   and physical_activity_final notebook contains model build using a max depth of 15
